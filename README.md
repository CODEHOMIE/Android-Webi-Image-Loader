# Android-Webi-Image-Loader
Android library #1 on GitHub. WIL aims is used for asynchronous remote image loading, caching and displaying. The purpose of the WIL is to abstract the downloading (images, pdf, zip, etc) and caching of remote resources (images, JSON, XML, etc) so that client code can easily "swap" a URL for any kind of files ( JSON, XML, etc) without worrying about any of the details. Resources which are reused often are continually re-downloaded and cached, WIL doesn't use infinite memory.
